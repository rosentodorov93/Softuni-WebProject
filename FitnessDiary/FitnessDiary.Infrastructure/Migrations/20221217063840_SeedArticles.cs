Rather, it’s about feeling great, having more energy, improving your health, and boosting your mood.By using these simple tips, you can cut through the confusion and learn how to create—and stick to—a tasty, varied, and nutritious diet that is as good for your mind as it is for your body.While some extreme diets may suggest otherwise, we all need a balance of protein, fat, carbohydrates, fiber, vitamins, and minerals in our diets to sustain a healthy body. You don't need to eliminate certain categories of food from your diet, but rather select the healthiest options from each category.Protein gives you the energy to get up and go—and keep going—while also supporting mood and cognitive function.Too much protein can be harmful to people with kidney disease, but the latest research suggests that many of us need more high-quality protein, especially as we age.That doesn't mean you have to eat more animal products—a variety of plant-based sources of protein each day can ensure your body gets all the essential protein it needs.Fat.Not all fat is the same. While bad fats can wreck your diet and increase your risk of certain diseases, good fats protect your brain and heart. In fact, healthy fats—such as omega - 3s—are vital to your physical and emotional health. Including more healthy fat in your diet can help improve your mood, boost your well - being, and even trim your waistline.Fiber.Eating foods high in dietary fiber(grains, fruit, vegetables, nuts, and beans) can help you stay regular and lower your risk for heart disease, stroke, and diabetes.It can also improve your skin and even help you to lose weight.Calcium.As well as leading to osteoporosis, not getting enough calcium in your diet can also contribute to anxiety, depression, and sleep difficulties.Whatever your age or gender, it's vital to include calcium-rich foods in your diet, limit those that deplete calcium, and get enough magnesium and vitamins D and K to help calcium do its job.Carbohydrates are one of your body's main sources of energy. But most should come from complex, unrefined carbs (vegetables, whole grains, fruit) rather than sugars and refined carbs. Cutting back on white bread, pastries, starches, and sugar can prevent rapid spikes in blood sugar, fluctuations in mood and energy, and a build-up of fat, especially around your waistline.", new DateTime(2022, 12, 17, 8, 38, 39, 568, DateTimeKind.Local).AddTicks(2335), "https://www.helpguide.org/wp-content/uploads/calories-counting-diet-food-control-and-weight-loss-concept-calorie-768.jpg", true, "Healthy Eating" },

In the short term, exercise helps to control appetite, boost mood, and improve sleep. In the long term, it reduces the risk of heart disease, stroke, diabetes, dementia, depression, and many cancers.Whether you were once much more physically active or have never been one to exercise regularly, now is a great time to start an exercise and fitness regimen. Getting and staying in shape is just as important for seniors as it is for younger people.The benefits of exercise on mental health are well documented. For example, one major study found that sedentary people are 44% more likely to be depressed. Another found that those with mild to moderate depression could get similar results to those obtained through antidepressants just by exercising for 90 minutes each week. The key appears to be the release of brain chemicals such as serotonin and dopamine, which help lift mood and combat stress.", new DateTime(2022, 12, 17, 8, 38, 39, 568, DateTimeKind.Local).AddTicks(2303), "https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcSbWHiBti3UenQIRzTJ03BATIcUowBOPZSqyA&usqp=CAU", true, "Exercise and Fitness" }
